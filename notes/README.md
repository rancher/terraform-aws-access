# Dev Notes

## What is this?

- A directory to dump my thoughts on design decisions and hopefully give insight to users and future devs on why things exist.

## This is unconventional and hard to read

- I agree, but if I don't put it somewhere it might not go anywhere
  - my assumption is that more information is better
- this doesn't replace conventional documentation
  - it provides a weird mind map of context for interested individuals who would like to understand the ideas and concerns

## How does this help future developers or maintainers?

- This is the best way to get the context behind paradigms, assumptions, use cases, and decisions
- With this on the table future developers can question the ideas and paradigms and develop better answers or solutions
